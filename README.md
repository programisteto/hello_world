The is the repository for the tutorial.

Hello guys. I'm pretty new to programming in general, although I have done a decent decent amount of stuff in Python from different courses taken, I am still embarassingly unaware of how to effectively use github. I will become good with this interface; seems pretty straightforward. I'd like to be effecient from the command line at some point, and I will spend time learning that. I various articles about different things in github, and think I get the concept. I was asked to write about myself, but I don't feel like spending time doing that, so I'm just going to copy my LinkIn summary below:

I'm a hard-working, analytical, personable, laid-back autodidact who will become a polymath. I have various interests that I regularly spend time learning about in an increasingly efficient way, and I bring this up because it embodies a philosophy that I hold dear: Continually become a better version of yourself spiritually, mentally, contemplatively, physically, emotionally. I routinely throw myself into difficult and unfamiliar situations. I'm a really curious guy who is no-where near done with his education. I have a very high-aptitude, and I say this not because I'm conceded, but because this is the job market. I have lists of information and skills I want to learn, and scheduled times to do so because I know that you have to put in work to accomplish things. I have experience working in groups for the many projects given in my mathematics and computer science courses. I often led the groups, managed even, but I not necessarily in an overbearing way, as I often ended up having to stay up many nights completing more than half, almost all, or all of each of these projects. These projects were usually always quite mentally challenging and often required papers and 10 to 20 minute presentations, most of which I wrote, organized, and presented. I can utilize my time purposefully and efficiently, but I also have a lot of experience working under a time crunch with familiar or unfamiliar tasks in stressful conditions, in unfamiliar settings, and on-the-go. Give me a chance and a task, and I'll figure out how to figure it out, and then I'll figure it out.

I would like to work for a company with a friendly, serious culture in a position where I can learn a lot. I am currently interested in web development, python programming, analyst, tutoring/teaching, technical paper writing, mathematical modelling, think tank, and research positions.

If you read this whole thing for whatever reason, pm if you want. I'm always accepting friendships and sharing the love.

Cheers,

Charles Lowry
